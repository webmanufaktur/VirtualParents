# CHANGES

## Fixed (added) namespace

In order to make VirtualParents work in most recent versions of Processwire (as new as 3.0.185-dev) 
the namespace is necessary within VirtualParents.module. Therefore I added it.



### Additional comments

Such a lovely module to keep the backend organized while using a flat hierarchy.
